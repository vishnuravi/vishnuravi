### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a physician & software developer passionate about building digital health applications that support clinical research, help make healthcare more accessible, and improve health outcomes.

At @StanfordBDHG, I work on @StanfordSpezi, an open-source framework for building modern, interoperable digital health applications, and teach @CS342, a course in building real-world solutions for clinical care and research.
