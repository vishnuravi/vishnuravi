### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a physician & software developer passionate about building digital health applications that support clinical research, help make healthcare more accessible, and improve health outcomes.

I'm currently the lead developer for [CardinalKit](https://cardinalkit.stanford.edu), an open-source iOS and Android framework for building digital health apps created at the [Stanford University Byers Center for Biodesign](https://biodesign.stanford.edu).

Check out [vishnu.io](https://vishnu.io) for more of my work in digital health and feel free to reach out via email at [vishnur@stanford.edu](vishnur@stanford.edu)!
